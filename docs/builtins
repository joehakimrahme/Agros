This file will describe the built-in functions that AGROS presents to the user.
Taken from the builtin help, here's the list of commands:

        help    print help
        ?       print short help

        cd      change directory
        exit    exit from AGROS

        env     print environment
        set     modify the environment
        unset   unset environment variable

env, set and unset let the user manipulate environment variables. Here's how to
use them.

$ env [arg]         : if arg is given, AGROS will look for an env variable named arg and
                      print it to the screen. If it doesn't exist, AGROS will print an
                      error message. If [arg] is not supplied, AGROS will print all the
                      enviroment variables.

$ set var=value     : creates an env variable named "var" and sets it to "value". If var
                      exists, its value is overwritten.

$ unset var         : unsets a given variable. If variable does not exist, nothing happens.



HELP command
############

The help command accpets these options:

    -a  print full help
    -b  print list of built in commands
    -s  print short help
    -w  print warnings

* Calling "help" with no option will execute "help -a"
* Calling "?" will execute "help -s"
