#  AGROS - The New Limited Shell #
##################################

    AGROS is my implementation in C of the Limited Shell (lshell). Lshell is a project
    developed by ghantoos (mouzannar@gmail.com). The project consists of a UNIX shell
    coded in Python, that restricts users to a set of predefined commands. You can find
    the original project here:

    http://lshell.ghantoos.org.

    AGROS aims at implementing lshell in C. The idea being to get rid of certain
    limitations of Python, namely:

    - The availability of the Python interpreter on a machine.
    - Versions management. (Lshell does not yet support Python 3)
    - Performance issues, most notably on embedded systems.

    This is why AGROS is rightfully named AGROS Got Rid Of the Snake. I'm pretty
    proud of that name :)

    The idea is to define in a conf file what commands the user can or cannot
    execute. It's a restrictive shell used for security puproses.


Version 0.1:
############

    * Release Date: 17/02/2011
    * Built-in functions:
        - cd
        - ?
        - env
        - exit
    * Using execvp() for process execution


Dependencies:
############

    These are available as packaged binaries for Debian. I haven't tried them on
    other Unices.

    * pkg-config
    * libglib2.0-dev


Installation:
#############

    Simply run make.

    So far there are no dependencies to the shell, but I'm planning on adding libglib-2.0.0
    as a first dependency to parse config files, and GNU Readline for better interactive
    prompt. (Although first attempts at adding GNU Readlien weren't the most successful).

    Once compiled, you can launch the shell with ./agros.


Configuration:
##############

    So far there is only one variable to define in the configuration agros.conf.
    Set the "allowed" array to a list of allowed commands in the shell. Separator should be ";"
    and make sure to leave no spaces between different items.
