#  AGROS - The New Limited Shell #
##################################
    
    AGROS is my implementation in C of the Limited Shell. It is an alternative for  
    users who don't want to deal with the hassle of Python, lower performance,      
    availability of the interpreter, and dealing with different versions. 
    
    This is why AGROS is rightfully named AGROS Got Rid Of the Snake. I'm pretty    
    proud of that name :)
    
    The idea is to define in a conf file what commands the user can or cannot       
    execute. It's a restrictive shell used for security puproses. 
    
    So far, as of version 0.0.2, I only have a shaky simplistic shell, so don't     
    expect it to be working right away. I'm only writing this README because github 
    asked me to :D



Installation:
#############

    Simply run make. You can then launch the shell with ./agros.
